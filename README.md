What makes it virtual? Well, it's supposed to replicate a physical programmable soundboard, but it's all in software. What makes it global? Your hotkeys work globally. Even if you have a full screen application (true fullscreen) open, it will still intercept key presses. I created this for a friend of mine, so any design choices were specifically of him. Feel free to use it, share it, edit it, whatever.
